In this work I determine the value of the vanila option, barier option (up and out), look back option, with analytical solution and different numerical method(Monte Carlo, differintial schemes). Also I calculated local stochastic volatility with Dupire's method on the market data(call option Apple's company from 2016 to 2021)
